 Elevator pitch: a one minute description of your application
skyTunes brings customized recipes that are based on weather conditions in your specific region. 
Overall, people are cooking more and more according to nutrition journal, especially among men. 
We avoid choice overload by curating recipe options according to environmental factors, increasing the chance that one of the recipes would be selected
We are creating a concept brand based on users environmental factors, something that may not always be considered

* Concept: What is your user story? What was your motivation for development?
As a budget conscious family, I need help figuring out healthy and affordable meal plans for my family that reduces our dependencies on processed foods


* Process: What were the technologies used? How were tasks and roles broken down and assigned? What challenges did you encounter? What were your successes?
We used 2 api’s and input fields to generate results
We faced knowledge gaps, one person on the team took care of a majority of the back end
We pivoted on music playlists based on weather conditions due to complex api’s
Successes were design elements that Emmett implemented 
We also had a backup api at the ready in case music API could not work

* Demo: Show your stuff!
Visit the website, enter your zip code, and pull up your weather condition and a curated list of recipes

* Directions for Future Development
SkyTunes would love to provide a 5 day forecast with curated meal plans based on weather for the week or day
We would love to add search parameters for recipes based on tastes, food allergies, nutrition needs, etc
Additionally, SkyTunes is a lifestyle brand based on weather. We would love to add features for holidays, vegetarians/vegans
We want to add playlists based on weather conditions down the line, with the option to select playlists for cooking events: holidays, tailgating, family bbqs, Sunday night dinners, birthdays, etc
We plan to bring in revenue based on advertisements
